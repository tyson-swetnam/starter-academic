My research interests include applied use of cyberinfrastructure for geospatial analysis, data science best practices (for reproducible research), as well as metadata and ontology (information science).

I teach workshops to other researchers via the CyVerse Learning Institute. I am an active member of the Carpentries and Research Bazaar Arizona.

A bit about me and my research experience:
My first career was in wildland firefighting. I spent summer seasons working for the US DOI National Park Service as a forestry technician, taking graduate courses in the fall and spring. Later, during my Ph.D. program, I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service.
